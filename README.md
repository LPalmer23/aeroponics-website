# 🌿 BU Aeroponics Project

**Vertical Aeroponics at Boston University**  
A Campus Climate Lab–funded research initiative in collaboration with the Institute for Global Sustainability.  
Our team explores how small, community-integrated aeroponic towers can reduce emissions, conserve water, and improve access to fresh food.
