# 🌿 BU Aeroponics Project

**Vertical Aeroponics at Boston University** — a Campus Climate Lab–funded research project in partnership with the Institute for Global Sustainability.  
Our team studies how small-scale, community-integrated aeroponic towers can reduce agricultural emissions, conserve water, and improve food security.
