        <h1>About Our Aeroponics Project</h1>
        <p>
          Funded by Boston Universityâ€™s Campus Climate Lab and guided by faculty in the Department of Earth & Environment, our team is researching how aeroponic farming, when implemented within pre-existing infrastructure, can contribute to addressing food insecurity and reducing emissions from traditional agricultural practices. By documenting the exact energy, water, and operational inputs required to sustain aeroponic tower systems, we aim to assess the viability of this approach as a scalable, climate-conscious supplement to conventional food systems.
          </p>

          <p>
          Our research also examines the collapse of recent commercial vertical farming ventures, despite billions in investment, to identify key operational pitfalls and inform more resilient, localized implementation strategies. By conserving space, water, and time, aeroponic systems offer measurable environmental benefits, including substantial reductions in carbon emissions. Our goal is to leverage these benefits while avoiding the challenges that hindered previous large-scale models.
